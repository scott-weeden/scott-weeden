### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about advanced cybersecurity techniques and AI.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to cybersecurity and AI.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with refining the SCOT model and making it more efficient.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my work on the LLM (llm) generative pre-trained text (GPT) model and how it's changing the cybersecurity landscape.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me at myemail@scott-weeden.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.
